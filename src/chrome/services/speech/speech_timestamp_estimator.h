// Helper class to match speech service transcriptions with the timestamps of
// the audio that originated the transcriptions. It does so by saving start
// timestamps in a FIFO and tracking how much audio has been sent to the speech
// service. Once a transcription is finalized, this class will retrieve the
// original timestamps based on "when" -- in audio time, not wall time -- the
// audio was sent to the speech service.
//
// This class deals with three types of `base::TimeDelta`, strongly typed as
// aliases to help avoid confusion:
// `MediaTimestamp`  : the originating media's timestamps. Media time can be
//                     seeked, but its playback rate is always 1.0, since the
//                     speech service receives audio before rate adjustments.
// `PlaybackDuration`: duration of the media sent to the speech service.
// `SpeechTimestamp` : starts at 0s and monotonically increases by the
//                     `PlaybackDuration` of every audio buffer sent to the
//                     speech service.
