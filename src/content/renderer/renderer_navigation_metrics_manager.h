// This class collects start and end times of different events pertaining to
// navigations in the renderer process. These events include RenderView/WebView
// creation, proxy creation, (possibly provisional) frame creation, and
// navigation commit. The main goal is to output a trace with the renderer's
// view of navigation events, as well as to record metrics for durations of
// those events. This is done by calling `RecordTraceEventsAndMetrics()` when a
// navigation finishes committing. The
// RendererNavigationMetricsManager::Timeline struct below keeps all the
// necessary timestamps for a single navigation.
//
// Multiple navigations may be in progress in the same renderer process, so this
// class keeps a map of Timelines keyed by "navigation metrics tokens", which
// are passed in by the browser process in IPCs related to navigations. Each
// navigation has a unique navigation metrics token, with the source of truth
// stored in the NavigationRequest.
//
// If a navigation starts creating view/frame/proxy objects but ends up not
// committing in this process, such as after a cross-process redirect or if the
// navigation is explicitly canceled by the user or another navigation, its
// timeline data is cleaned up lazily. In particular, a navigation's timestamps
// are cleaned up if the navigation hasn't committed after a 5-minute timeout -
// see note in RendererNavigationMetricsManager::GetOrCreateTimeline() about how
// this works, and why using explicit cancellation signals is hard. The goal is
// to change this into explicit cleanup in the future by improving signals for
// navigation cancellations and making them aware of navigation metrics tokens.
//
// There is one global RendererNavigationMetricsManager object in each renderer
// process, accessible via the `Instance()` method below.
