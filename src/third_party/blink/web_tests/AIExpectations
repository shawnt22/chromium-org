# results: [ Timeout Crash Pass Failure Skip ]

# Some of AI related API tests can pass only on Optimization Guide Bots. So they
# are skipped or marked as flaky by the defaut TestExpectations.
# When Optimization Guide Bots run AI related API tests, the default
# TestExpectations file is ignored and this file is referred.

# Temporarily disable flaky Language Detector tests to unblock model validation testing.
# Disables tests on all platforms, since disabling these tests on Mac only is not supported.
