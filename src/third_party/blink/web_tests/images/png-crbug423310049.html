In https://crbug.com/423310049 the color space transformation wasn't quite
right - with the test image below the symptom was that yellow and cyan
bands were swapped (magenta and black bands were preserved).
<p>
The test image below was created by
<ul>
  <li>Taking IHDR, IDAT, and IEND chunks from basn2c08 from the PNG test suite
  <li>Taking iCCP chunk from the repro image from https://crbug.com/423310049
</ul>
