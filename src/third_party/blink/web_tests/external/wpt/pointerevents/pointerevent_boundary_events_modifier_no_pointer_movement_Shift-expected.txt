This is a testharness.js-based test.
[FAIL] Test shiftKey of pointer boundary events (modifiers are changed before move): shiftKey of pointerover should be true
  assert_true: expected true got false
[FAIL] Test shiftKey of pointer boundary events (modifiers are changed before move): shiftKey of pointerout should be true
  assert_true: expected true got false
[FAIL] Test shiftKey of pointer boundary events (modifiers are changed after move): shiftKey of pointerover should be true
  assert_true: expected true got false
[FAIL] Test shiftKey of pointer boundary events (modifiers are changed after move): shiftKey of pointerout should be true
  assert_true: expected true got false
Harness: the test ran to completion.
