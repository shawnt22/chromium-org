// `SoftNavigationPaintAttributionTracker` helps attribute contentful paints to
// DOM nodes that were modified as part of an interaction, working together with
// `PrePaintTreeWalk` to maintain a mapping of `Node` to `SoftNavigationContext`
// for relevant nodes. It works as follows:
//
// All `LayoutObject`s have bits indicating:
//   1. whether the node's relevant `SoftNavigationContext` has changed
//      (initially true)
//   2. whether any of the node's descendants' `SoftNavigationContext` has
//      changed (initially false)
//   3. whether the node should inherit its parent's `SoftNavigationContext`
//      (initially true)
//
// After a pre-paint walk, without any interactions, bits (1) and (2) are false,
// and bit (3) is true for all to-be-painted `LayoutObject`s.
//
// When an attributable DOM modification occurs, `MarkNodeAsDirectlyModified()`
// is called for the (`Node`, `SoftNavigationContext`), and this mapping is
// recorded in `marked_nodes_`.  If the `Node` has a `LayoutObject` -- which
// depends if the layout has run for the node -- bits (1) and (2) are updated
// accordingly. Note: the full tree is re-walked as needed when the DOM
// structure changes, i.e. in the case that layout hasn't run.
//
// During pre-paint, `UpdateOnPrePaint()` is called for each modified node and
// its descendants to push down the context and update internal state. The
// `SoftNavigationPaintAttributionTracker::PrePaintUpdateResult` returned by
// this method is used by the pre-paint layer to set bit (3). That bit is used
// on subsequent pre-paint walks (for non-modified nodes) to determine if the
// parent context should be used, or if this is a new root, in which case the
// this root's context will be used.
//
// Subsequent interactions: if a node is modified by more than one interaction,
// paints are attributed to the most recent modification. This is accomplished
// by updating the mapping during `UpdateOnPrePaint()`.
//
// Contentful nodes: paints are only tracked for text and image nodes, which
// allows us to avoid storing the entire descendant subtree for modified nodes.
// But since text is aggregated by `TextPaintTimingDetector` up to the nearest
// non-anonymous, non-inline layout object's node, this is what we store for
// attributable text nodes.
//
// But, we need to be careful not to over-attribute DOM modifications and
// paints. For example, <body> can be a text attribution node if a
// display:inline element is added directly to <body>, for example:
//
// <body><b>Some text</b></body>
//
// And if such an element is appended to <body>, we want to track the paints
// for the element, but not propagate the change to all descendants of <body>.
// This is handled by only propagating directly modified nodes during the
// pre-paint walk.
