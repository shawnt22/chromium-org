Description:
The Chrome Enterprise Companion App (CECA) is built from Chromium source, but
placed into third_party to permit integration testing with version-skewed
binaries. New versions of CECA are automatically imported into CIPD by
the 3pp scripts in this directory, and //DEPS defines which versions of the
CECA are pulled from CIPD into the source checkout.

To update the versions of CECA in this directory, wait for the version
you want to become available in CIPD, then update //DEPS to point to it. If the
files change, you may also have to update //BUILD.gn.
