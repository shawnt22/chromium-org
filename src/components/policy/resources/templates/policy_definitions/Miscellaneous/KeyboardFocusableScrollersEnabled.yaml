caption: Enable keyboard focusable scrollers
default: true
deprecated: true
desc: |-
  This policy provides a temporary opt-out for the new keyboard focusable scrollers behavior.

  When this policy is Enabled or unset, scrollers without focusable children are keyboard-focusable by default.

  When this policy is Disabled, scrollers will not be keyboard-focusable by default.

  This policy is a temporary workaround. From M139, this policy is deprecated.
