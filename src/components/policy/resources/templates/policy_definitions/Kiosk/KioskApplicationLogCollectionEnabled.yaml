  Setting the policy to Enabled means Kiosk application level logs would be collected when a kiosk application is running on the device. Logs would be collected for all kiosk application types.
  These logs would be stored in a separate kiosk_apps.log file.
  Leaving this policy unset or setting it to Disabled means the Kiosk application level logs would not be collected.
