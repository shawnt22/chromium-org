caption: Block sites from making requests to local network endpoints.

desc: |-
  List of URL patterns. Requests initiated from websites served by matching origins are blocked from issuing <ph name="LOCAL_NETWORK_ACCESS">Local Network Access</ph> requests.

  If an origin is covered by both this policy and by LocalNetworkAccessAllowedForUrls, this policy takes precedence.

  Depending on the stage of the rollout of <ph name="LOCAL_NETWORK_ACCESS">Local Network Access</ph>, LocalNetworkAccessRestrictionsEnabled may also need to be enabled for this policy to block <ph name="LOCAL_NETWORK_ACCESS">Local Network Access</ph> requests.

  For origins not covered by the patterns specified here, the user's personal configuration will apply.

  For detailed information on valid URL patterns, please see https://cloud.google.com/docs/chrome-enterprise/policies/url-patterns.

  See https://github.com/explainers-by-googlers/local-network-access for <ph
  name="LOCAL_NETWORK_ACCESS">Local Network Access</ph> restrictions.
