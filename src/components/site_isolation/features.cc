// In order to have broader support for JavaScript optimizer exceptions, we'll

// that was specified in the rules but there currently isn't a way to determine
// this from the host_content_settings_map API, so we'll improve this in the

// On Android, this implicitly starts isolating origins under partial site
// isolation. If full site isolation is enabled (examples: through opt-in or an

// targets an origin that is not already origin-isolated.
